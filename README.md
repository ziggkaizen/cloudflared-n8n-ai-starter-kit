# Cloudflared N8N - Self-hosted AI starter kit

**Self-hosted AI Starter Kit** is an open-source Docker Compose template designed to swiftly initialize a comprehensive local AI and low-code development environment.
Curated by <https://github.com/n8n-io>, it combines the self-hosted n8n platform with a curated list of compatible AI products and components to quickly get started with building self-hosted AI workflows.

The **Cloudflared N8N AI Starter Kit (This fork)** builds on the original Self-hosted AI Starter Kit by integrating Cloudflared and an Nginx reverse proxy. This enhancement allows you to deploy your local n8n instance behind a secure reverse proxy using your own domain. With this setup, your locally installed n8n becomes accessible from the internet while maintaining the benefits of local hosting, such as improved data privacy and control. The integration provides a robust and flexible solution for securely managing and accessing your AI workflows.

Additionally it comes with a preinstalled workflow for taking backups of your workflows and credentioals, locally saved as json files. Hope you find this helpfull. Cheers!

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. A registered domain of your own.
2. A Cloudflare account (free sign-up available at <https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up>).
3. Your domain must be added to your Cloudflare account.
4. Your domain must be configured with Cloudflare DNS.

### Setting up your tunnel

Follow the steps below or follow this detailed guide to set up your tunnel:

[How to set up a cloudflared tunnel - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lIIS_uWS5SR4RGdggBQ0fXtszF7SdgbzqdngbgTR0Gc/edit?usp=sharing)

 1. Sign in to your Cloudflare account at [cloudflare.com/login](https://cloudflare.com/login).  
 2. In the left-hand menu, click on **Zero Trust**.  
 3. Within the Zero Trust dashboard, navigate to **Network ‚Üí Tunnels** and then select **Add a tunnel**.  
 4. Click on **Select Cloudflared**.  
 5. Enter a name of your choice for the tunnel.  
 6. Click the **Save tunnel** button.  
 7. Choose any environment and copy the terminal command that includes your personal token.  
 8. Extract the token from the command and store it securely. Do not share this token with anyone. (For example, you should see a token similar to the one in this Docker command:  
   ```
   docker run cloudflare/cloudflared:latest tunnel --no-autoupdate run --token eyJhIjoiNDNlMjVmYjcxODNkNDZhZjRmYzdiYzExOWU3YmVmZWEiLCJ0IjoiNzM5NDE2YjI0OTNlYTFlZmI4MjZmODhlZjY3MWRhNGQiLCJzIjoiTWpReU1qVXdPRFl4TWpReU56Z3pNRGcxTWpneSIsImIiOiJwYXlsb2FkIn0=
   ```  
   )  
 9. Finally, click the **Next** button.
10. Finally set up your traffic routing.

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ziggkaizen/cloudflared-n8n-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
```

### Running n8n using Docker Compose

#### For Nvidia GPU users

```
git clone https://github.com/ziggkaizen/cloudflared-n8n-ai-starter-kit.git
cd cloudflared-n8n-ai-starter-kit
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up -d
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not used your Nvidia GPU with Docker before, please follow the
> [Ollama Docker instructions](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/docker.md).

### For AMD GPU users on Linux

```
git clone https://github.com/ziggkaizen/cloudflared-n8n-ai-starter-kit.git
cd cloudflared-n8n-ai-starter-kit
docker compose --profile gpu-amd up -d
```

#### For Mac / Apple Silicon users

If you‚Äôre using a Mac with an M1 or newer processor, you can't expose your GPU
to the Docker instance, unfortunately. There are two options in this case:

1. Run the starter kit fully on CPU, like in the section "For everyone else"
   below
2. Run Ollama on your Mac for faster inference, and connect to that from the
   n8n instance

If you want to run Ollama on your mac, check the
[Ollama homepage](https://ollama.com/)
for installation instructions, and run the starter kit as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/ziggkaizen/cloudflared-n8n-ai-starter-kit.git
cd cloudflared-n8n-ai-starter-kit
docker compose up -d
```

##### For Mac users running OLLAMA locally

If you're running OLLAMA locally on your Mac (not in Docker), you need to modify the OLLAMA_HOST environment variable
in the n8n service configuration. Update the x-n8n section in your Docker Compose file as follows:

```yaml
x-n8n: &service-n8n
  # ... other configurations ...
  environment:
    # ... other environment variables ...
    - OLLAMA_HOST=host.docker.internal:11434
```

Additionally, after you see "Editor is now accessible via: <https://subdomain.example.com>":

1. Head to <https://subdomain.example.com/home/credentials>
2. Click on "Local Ollama service"
3. Change the base URL to "http://host.docker.internal:11434/"

#### For everyone else

```
git clone https://github.com/ziggkaizen/cloudflared-n8n-ai-starter-kit.git
cd cloudflared-n8n-ai-starter-kit
docker compose --profile cpu up -d
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start and usage

The core of the Self-hosted AI Starter Kit is a Docker Compose file, pre-configured with network and storage settings, minimizing the need for additional installations.
After completing the installation steps above, simply follow the steps below to get started.

1. Open <https://subdomain.example.com/> (tour domain) in your browser to set up n8n. You‚Äôll only
   have to do this once.
2. Open the included workflow:
   <https://subdomain.example.com/workflow/srOnR8PAY3u4RSwb>
3. Click the **Chat** button at the bottom of the canvas, to start running the workflow.
4. If this is the first time you‚Äôre running the workflow, you may need to wait
   until Ollama finishes downloading Llama3.2. You can inspect the docker
   console logs to check on the progress.

To open n8n at any time, visit <https://subdomain.example.com/> (your domain) in your browser.

With your n8n instance, you‚Äôll have access to over 400 integrations and a
suite of basic and advanced AI nodes such as
[AI Agent](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/),
[Text classifier](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.text-classifier/),
and [Information Extractor](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.information-extractor/)
nodes. To keep everything local, just remember to use the Ollama node for your
language model and Qdrant as your vector store.

> [!NOTE]
> This starter kit is designed to help you get started with self-hosted AI
> workflows. While it‚Äôs not fully optimized for production environments, it
> combines robust components that work well together for proof-of-concept
> projects. You can customize it to meet your specific needs

## Tips & tricks

### Accessing local files

The self-hosted AI starter kit will create a shared folder (by default,
located in the same directory) which is mounted to the n8n container and
allows n8n to access files on disk. This folder within the n8n container is
located at `/data/shared` -- this is the path you‚Äôll need to use in nodes that
interact with the local filesystem.
